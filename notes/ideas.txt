Make a TEST or mention in README file that it is for a small patch/area.
Maybe add some limits on the number of grid points when this approach is not practical?

Maybe create another instance of grid, using the element indices instead of element values as the basis.

I have developed a self-contained, memory-safe Python wrapper for general 2D Cartesian grid generation. This utility is not specific to our project's core tasks and was developed independently. I would like to publish it as open source on my personal GitHub account under permissive licence e.g., MIT, as a personal project. Please provide any feedback or approval witihn 10 working days. I have already asked INAF  IP Office for guidance as well, and am in conversation with them to follow INAF policies.


## Project for Open Source Release: Memory-Safe Cartesian Grid Wrapper

This project aims to develop an open-source Python utility to simplify and optimize the creation of large, high-resolution 2D Cartesian grids from two 1D axes. This technique is applicable to any field requiring efficient gridded data structures.

* **Problem:** Generating a  grid currently forces a choice: use the intuitive but memory-intensive  (which temporarily doubles memory usage by creating two large 2D arrays), or use the cryptic but memory-efficient / array manipulation. This dilemma compromises either **code clarity** or **memory stability** for large grids.

* **Solution:** Create an intuitive wrapper function for inputs, while under the hood there is a memory-efficient numpy work. 

* **Goal:** To establish a **robust, clear, and memory-safe standard** for generating massive 2D grids, promoting best practices across all scientific fields that rely on NumPy. Accessible to large set of users with minimal coding background.
