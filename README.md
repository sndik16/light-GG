# Light-GG

## SUMMARY
This is just a small code which creates a coordinate grid.
The coordinate grid is a 2D Grid model.

It is light on memory usage using python concepts.
However, its inputs are intuitive for humans (The KEY aspect of this code package), who can use their school geometry knowledge to use the program.



## APPLICATION EXAMPLES
The application is, for example, a rectangular sky coordinate system in astronomy, for mapping galaxies or survey coverage.
Another applications could be terrestrial coverage, for example surveys of land area. For example, if radar monitoring is done with aircraft over certain fields or if some pesticide spraying needs to be carried out over land.


## DISCLAIMER
This project was developed while I worked at INAF as a postdoc, but during my independent time.
